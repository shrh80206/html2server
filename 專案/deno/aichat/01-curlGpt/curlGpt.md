It is a type of machine learning model that uses a transformer architecture to generate human-like text based on a given input prompt. GPT models are pre-trained on large amounts of text data and can be fine-tuned for specific tasks such as language translation, text generation, and question answering. These models have been widely used in natural language processing applications and have gained popularity for their ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant text."
